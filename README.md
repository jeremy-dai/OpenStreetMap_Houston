# Audit OpenStreetMap data for Greater Houston Area

## Intro
This project chose the Great Houston Area and used data munging techniques to assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity. The following steps are accomplished in the project: 
- Audited dataset (800+mb) in XML format for Greater Houston Area
- Fixed street names and deleted problematic nodes and ways
- Found the most popular cuisine and religion in Houston using SQLite 	

## Data Source
The data is from OpenStreetMap. You can download the Greater Houston Area data that I used [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/71oy6p53ibou2g6/AADQa8t_l4QShQ0mr2YuDmlQa?dl=0).
